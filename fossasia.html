						<br><h2 class="alt">MY GSOC-15 PROJECT PROPOSAL</h2>
						<h3>Organisation: FOSSASIA</h3>
						<h3>Mentor: Andreas</h3>
						<strong>[ More Content will be added soon ]</strong>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>About Myself and Experiences / Skills:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Myself Kumar Rishav. I am a third year undergraduate student pursuing Computer Science Engineering at National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirapalli, India and expect to graduate in July 2016.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Open Source Development Experience</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Personally, I have always been a FOSS enthusiast and &nbsp;love Open Source Technologies. I have been contributing to open source from past more than one year. Also i am a <strong>GSOCer - 2014</strong>, and successfully completed the GSOC project under <strong>Mozilla</strong> Organisation last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Details of my projects and experience/skills can be found at&nbsp;<a href="https://kumarrishav.github.io">https://kumarrishav.github.io</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino;">Work Commitment: 30 to 40 hours each week during GSOC period</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino;">Short description about Project:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">LuCI is the main web configuration interface for OpenWrt. It is an easy way to edit the device&rsquo;s configuration files. However, initially the web interface looked horribly outdated, but now we have a fresh and professional-looking theme based on twitter Bootstrap (v2.0). Now, it's high time to move the luci bootstrap theme to v3.0 and add new components with new features and update the existing ones to make it compatible</span>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Planning and Execution details of Project with Timeline:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">[&nbsp;It contains features proposed by mentor along with inputs of my own on new features &amp; workflow ]</span></em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;"><strong><em>27th April to 25th May (Community Bonding period)</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">Digging more into the Openwrt/luci project. Get to know mentor and community, read documentation, get up to speed to begin working on the projects and build system which is required for development. Though Lua is not main part of this project, still i will get &nbsp;aware of lua and have good grip on back-end development in lua. Draft UI/UX for new or updated theme and get it reviewed by Mentor Andreas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino;"><em>Module 1 (First Priority)<br />26th May to 26th June (Official coding period starts)&nbsp;</em></span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">As twitter bootstrap(v2.0) is outdated, we are planning to move on bootstrap(v3.0). Now luci bootstrap theme will be based on Bootstrap(v3.0).&nbsp;Also, along with updating the existing theme, we (me along with guidance of mentor: Andreas) will develop new theme with great and awesome user experience alongwith new meta components (e.g. data tables, node info boxes).</span><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;">So what's new in Bootstrap (v3.0) ?</span><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;">a) Bootstrap now has a new flat design on all elements and components.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;">b) Bootstrap now redesigned and rebuilt to start from your handheld devices and scale up. Responsive Css is no longer separate and all responsive features are now included into the main file. That can be great for most people, but not everyone needs or wants an adaptive web site or application.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;">c) New powerful grid system. The new grid is significantly simplified and combined into one single grid system: the separate fluid grid system, container, and layout are removed, as they&rsquo;re down to one grid.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This kitchen-sink-included pile of code will make the design and development of web interface a lot easier. It will be one responsive, device-size independent, fluid grid system that appropriately scales up to 12 columns as the device or viewport size increases. And the four tiers of grid classes &ndash; phones, tablets, desktops, and large desktops &ndash; allow us to create complex and adaptive layouts with ease.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Review and feedback on this module and fix bugs as well as write a small documentation on it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><em><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino;">Module 2</span></strong></em></span><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><em><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino;">27th June to 30th June</span></strong></em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Write LESS for Css written in module - 1. It won't take more than two-three days. It's Sub-module of previous module.&nbsp;LESS is a dynamic stylesheet language that can be compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (Css), or can run on the client-side and server-side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Get a quick feedback on code from Andreas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;"><em><strong><em><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino;">Module 3</span></strong></em><br /><em><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino;">1st &nbsp;July to 15th &nbsp;July</span></strong></em></strong></em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 14pt;"><em><strong>Part - 1</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Convert icons/images into Vector graphics.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Vector graphics is the use of geometrical primitives such as points, lines, curves, and shapes or polygons&mdash;all of which are based on mathematical expressions&mdash;to represent images in computer graphics. Vector graphics are based on vectors (also called paths). Vector graphics can be magnified infinitely without loss of quality, while pixel-based graphics cannot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong><em><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino;">Part - 2</span></em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">&lt;---<strong>Difficult and most important part</strong>---&gt;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This will be most crucial part of the project. During this period we will work on optimising our code so that file size get reduced. Currently luci bootstrap theme is about 50kb. We will try not to exceed this and will improve our code as much as possible.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Minimize everything so that, it will fit on 4MB flash devices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><em><strong><em><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino;">Module 4</span></strong></em><br /><em><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino;">16th &nbsp;July to 31st &nbsp;July</span></strong></em></strong></em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">We will integrate the new created(as well as updated) theme with the openwrt/luci theme. This time will be used for testing all components, fixing bugs and responsiveness so that it works well on mobile, tablet device too along with desktop and gives a better user experience.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Testing and reviewing the complete code and giving the above finished module a final touch.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Each module will be reviewed by Mentor Andreas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><em><strong><em><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino;">Module 5</span></strong></em><br /><em><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino;">Rest of time left (1st August to 21th August)</span></strong></em></strong></em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>&lt;---Next aim of the project (Least priority)---&gt;</strong>&nbsp;<br />If time permits, we will work on freifunk themes, same like what we planned for bootstrap theme. First polish the existing one and later create a new one for same.<br />But this won't be our first priority.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">'Pencils Down' date by Google. Work on documentation of codes and explanation of new theme along with details of new features and components. Scrub code, write tests (if any need), improve documentation, etc and finally, submission of code to Gsoc website.</span></p>
